title: ABCD (Access to Biological Collection Data)
slug: abcd-access-biological-collection-data
description: <p>The <a href="http://www.tdwg.org/standards/115/">Access to Biological
  Collections Data (ABCD) Schema</a> is an evolving comprehensive standard for the
  access to and exchange of data about specimens and observations (a.k.a. primary
  biodiversity data). The ABCD Schema attempts to be comprehensive and highly structured,
  supporting data from a wide variety of databases. It is compatible with several
  existing data standards. Parallel structures exist so that either (or both) atomised
  data and free-text can be accommodated.</p><p>The ABCD Schema was ratified as
  a standard by the Biodiversity Information Standards Taxonomic Databases Working
  Group (TDWG) in 2005. It was developed as a community-driven effort, with
  contributions from CODATA, BioCASE and GBIF among other organizations.</p>
