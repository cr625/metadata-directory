title: AVM (Astronomy Visualization Metadata)
slug: avm-astronomy-visualization-metadata
description: <p>The <a href="http://www.virtualastronomy.org/avm_metadata.php">AVM</a> scheme
  supports the cross-searching of collections of print-ready and screen-ready astronomical
  imagery rendered from telescopic observations (also known as &#8216;pretty pictures&#8217;).
  The scheme is compatible with the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/xmp/">Adobe
  XMP</a> specification, so the metadata can be embedded within common image formats
  such as JPEG, TIFF and PNG.</p><p>Such images can combine data acquired at different
  wavebands and from different observatories. While the primary intent is to cover
  data-derived astronomical images, there are broader uses as well. Specifically,
  the most general subset of this schema is also appropriate for describing artwork
  and illustrations of astronomical subject matter.</p><p>AVM is a proposed recommendation
  of the International Virtual Observatory Alliance and was last updated in 2011.</p>
